# Chatbot using BERT and Streamlit

<!-- Description of the app ... -->

This chatbot was fine tuned using the BERT model and the SQuAD dataset. The dataset was tokenized and stored in a Pinecone index. The chatbot uses the Pinecone index to find the most similar question to the user's input and returns the answer to the question. The chatbot is deployed using Streamlit.
